<h1>Coding Process</h1>

<h2> Database Management</h2>

<p> Aiming for simple connection between databases, I attempted to limit the nessaccity of join tables for my MVP. 

The idea was that user were able to create an account easily and later set up there user profile. I beleived this offers the user a chance to try out the website and experience its functionality prior to commiting time online folio.


While I was not able to get these up and running in time, deplaoyed a temporary site, that I will redeploy through heroku, when I have finish connecting the databases to the app.</p>


<h2> Responsive Design </h2>

<p>While creating the a responsive navigation with a css only drop down was difficult at first, once I understood how to link up the menu with a check box, the composition came together quite quickly.  I now understand that to create a responsive website, an agile dev must use a mixture of grid, flex box and block elements.

Future improvements for navigation would be to remove the repeated code for the full screen application, tighten up the full screen nav and add transition effects to smooth the process of the drop down menu.</p>

<h2> After Thought</h2>

<p>Unfortunatlet due to unforseen circumstances I was not able to fully realise the functionality of my app within the two week deadline.

From here I will aim to: 
•   finish the connection to the Profiles and Projects board
•   intergrate a continious feed onto the home page
•   fix bugging upper nav and refactor excessive code
•   create a user search function with filter options to enhance user experience
•   connect shrine image uplaoder so user can upload files into projects and profiles
•   stress test with live users and explore possibility of live deployment
